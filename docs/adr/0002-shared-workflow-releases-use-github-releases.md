# 2. Shared Workflow Releases use GitHub Releases

Date: 2025-02-03

## Status

Accepted

## Context

When creating new releases (tags) in this repository, a manual method was used
to create a change log for every release with all the changes since the last
release. This would need to be committed in a separate PR, be merged, and then
a new tag created off that new commit in `main` to release the new version.
This wasn't a huge investment of time, but it still made releasing a new
version more of a task than it needed to be.

## Decision

All of the processes involved in creating a release like this is already a
feature in GitHub called
[Releases](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/about-releases).
It makes sense to just use the GitHub feature instead of doing this all
manually for little to no benefit.

## Consequences

Moving to Releases has several benefits. Firstly, it is a well documented
feature in GitHub, so it will be easier for current and new team members to
just use a pre-existing feature in GitHub. That in combination with newer
automation that automatically tags PRs correctly so that the change notes
can be autogenerated means that new releases will be much quicker and easier.
