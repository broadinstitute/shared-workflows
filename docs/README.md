# shared-workflows

GitHub Action workflows that can be shared by multiple repositories

## Provided Workflows

### Default parameters

All workflows in this repository provide at least the following default
parameters that can be passed with `with:` from calling repositories:

- `jobs_run_on`: The runner group on which jobs will run. Default:
  `ubuntu-latest`
- `timeout_minutes`: The maximum time (in minutes) for a job to run. Default:
  `5`
- `working_directory`: The working directory where all jobs should be executed.
  Default: `.`

### adr-check-toc.yaml

This workflow runs `adrs generate toc --ordered` command using
[adrs](https://github.com/joshrotenberg/adrs) to generate the Table of Contents
for the ADRs in the repository. The workflow assumes the output goes to the
`README.md` in the same directory as the ADRs. This check makes sure PRs haven't
forgotten to run this command as part of their commits.

### ansible-lint.yaml

This workflow will setup [Python][5] (`3.12`) and lint the repository using both
[yamllint][13] and [ansible-lint](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-lint).
[Poetry][3] is used to install the [Python][5] dependencies. Both [yamllint][13]
and [ansible-lint](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-lint) are expected to be
installed by the [Poetry][3] configuration in the repository using this
workflow.

#### ansible-lint Inputs

- `additional_packages`: String of additional packages that should be installed.
  Default: ``
- `python_version`: The version of [Python][5] to use. Default: `3.12`

### close-stale.yaml

This workflow will close any issues or PRs that have been inactive for a certain
amount of time. By default, this is set to 30 days. This workflow is based on
the `actions/stale`.

```YAML
---
name: 'Close stale issues and PRs'

'on':
  schedule:
    - cron: '30 1 * * *'

jobs:
  stale:
    uses: broadinstitute/shared-workflows/.github/workflows/close-stale.yaml
```

#### close-stale Inputs

- `days_before_issue_stale`: Number of days before an issue is considered stale.
  Default to 60
- `days_before_pr_stale`: Description: Number of days before a PR is considered
  stale. Default to 60
- `days_before_issue_close`: The idle number of days before closing the stale
  issues or the stale pull requests (due to the stale label). Defaults to 5
- `days_before_pr_close`: The idle number of days before closing the stale
  issues or the stale pull requests (due to the stale label). Defaults to 10

### conventional-commit.yaml

This workflow will run the[commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/) By default it
only checks that PR titles follow [Conventional Commits][1]. In addition the

- `validate_pr_title`: Validate PR title. Default: true
- `validate_current_commit`: Validate current commit (last commit). Default:
  false
- validate_pr_commits: Validate PR commits. Default: false

#### Conventional Release-Labels

The conventional commit workflow will also add labels to the PR based on based
on Conventional Commits. By default, only labels are added.

These labels can be used in conjunction GitHub's
[automatically generated release notes](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/automatically-generated-release-notes)

In order to use this automatic release notes feature, you must have a
`.github/release.yaml` file similar to the following:

```YAML
changelog:
  exclude:
    labels:
      - ignore-for-release
    authors:
      - octocat
  categories:
    - title: Breaking Changes ðŸ› 
      labels:
        - breaking
    - title: Exciting New Features ðŸŽ‰
      labels:
        - feature
    - title: Fixes ðŸ”§
      labels:
        - fix
    - title: Other Changes
      labels:
        - "*"
```

More info on this can be found in the
[release labels action](https://github.com/bcoe/conventional-release-labels?tab=readme-ov-file#conventional-release-labels)

## Releases

Releases are now done through the GitHub
[Release](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/about-releases)
system. The easiest way to create a new release draft is using the GitHub CLI
(`gh`). For example, to create a new draft release for version `v2.7.0` with
autogenerated notes:

```Shell
gh release create v2.7.0 --draft --generate-notes --title v2.7.0
